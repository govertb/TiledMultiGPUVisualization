/*
 The following code is a modified version of the CUDA BarnesHut v3.1 code
 by Martin Burtscher. Modifications were made to transform the code from a
 three-dimensional Barnes-Hut implementation to a two-dimensional implementation.
 Since our application (graph layout) only needs two dimensions.

 What follows is the copyright notice associated with that
 original code, as it is provided by the copyright holder:
